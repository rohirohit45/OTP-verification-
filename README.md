OTP-VERIFICATION-USING-PYTHON
OTP Verification is the process of verifying a user by sending a unique password so that the user can be verified before completing a registration or payment process. Most of the time, we get an OTP when we make an online payment, or when we forget our password, or when creating an account on any online platform. Thus, the sole purpose of an OTP is to verify the identity of a user by sending a unique password.

This is created using Python by following the steps:

First, I created a 6-digit random number
Then stored the number in a variable
Then I wrote a program to send emails
When sending email, I've used OTP as a message
I requested two user inputs; first for the userâ€™s email and then for the OTP that the user has received
